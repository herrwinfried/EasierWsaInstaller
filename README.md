I created my project just to make it easy for you to install. It provides further simplification of installation using Project named "[WSAGAScript](https://github.com/ADeltaX/WSAGAScript)".
# Things to do before installation

- Windows 11
- Ubuntu WSL
- OpenGapps
- WSA msixbundle file

## **Virtual Machine Platform must be active.**
> Open windows terminal as administrator. You can easily enable it by typing the following command. You should have enabled Ubuntu WSL when you installed it.
```
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

## Developer Mode must be turned on.
