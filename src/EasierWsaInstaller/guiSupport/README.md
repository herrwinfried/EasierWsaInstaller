# **Only [EasierWsaInstallerGui Project](https://github.com/herrwinfried/EasierWsaInstallerGui)**
_Powershell help for Project EasierWsaInstallerGui. Normally the Project only covers Bash(script). But there is a GUI project because not everyone can use the CLI. It would be silly to write bash directly in bash in this GUI project. Because windows works better in Powershell._

**EasierWsaInstallerGui is designed for the way it will be used. If you run it yourself and get an error, you're on your own.**
